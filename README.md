# Hypno Burgers

### Overview

Hypno Burgers is a tasty full stack site where a user is presented with a list of burgers. If desired, a user may "Devour!" the burger, moving it to a devoured section. If the user is still hungry, they can create their own burger by entering a name of a burger and having it then be added to the burger database, where it will sit until consumed.

### Technologies

This is a full stack site. It uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Jquery for the front-end, and MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and JawsDB for the back-end database setup. It is also deployed on Heroku.
